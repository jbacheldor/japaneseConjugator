Hi ! 

This is just a vanilla js japanese conjugator. 

To-do:

- okay so - need to add in letters like "pya" and "kyo" and all that good stuff
- need to fix navigation because it's currently shot
- need to implement api calls to get data according to whatever is passed to the quiz 
- need to add in results page
- ok need to reconfigure the superscript b/c it's off if there are two letters now
- aso need to change how many items show up b/c it's showing kanji and not hiragana
- alsooooo need to make it so they adjust to the box size
- need to add in jlpt stuff 
- i'm sure i could also optimize in other ways
