Hi ! 

This is just a vanilla js japanese conjugator. 

To-do:

- Figure out best way to hold in data 
- is there a way for program to take keyboard input without a textbox? or is that only for mobile devices 
- maybe instead i should make this an electron app 
- get base lines for home pages set up

 Game is deployed at the following link: https://jbacheldor.github.io/japaneseConjugator/
