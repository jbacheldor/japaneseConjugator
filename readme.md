Hi ! 

This is just a vanilla js japanese conjugator. 

To-do:

- okay so - need to add in letters like "pya" and "kyo" and all that good stuff
- need to fix navigation because it's currently shot
- need to implement api calls to get data according to whatever is passed to the quiz 
- need to add in results page
- need to add in jlpt stuff 
- i'm sure i could also optimize in other ways 

 Game is deployed at the following link: https://jbacheldor.github.io/japaneseConjugator/
